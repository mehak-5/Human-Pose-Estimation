Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning
This repository contains code for human pose estimation, a critical task in computer vision that involves identifying the key points of the human body (such as joints and limbs) from images or videos. Pose estimation has applications in various domains, including augmented reality, robotics, human-computer interaction, sports analytics, and healthcare.

Overview
Human pose estimation refers to the task of detecting the positions of key body parts (such as head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles) in images or videos. By using machine learning, especially deep learning models, this task has achieved remarkable accuracy and efficiency.

This repository provides an implementation of human pose estimation using state-of-the-art machine learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and popular pose estimation architectures like OpenPose or PoseNet. The system can detect 2D and 3D human poses in real-time or from pre-recorded media.

Features
Pose Detection: Accurately detects key body parts and estimates pose in both static images and dynamic video frames.
Real-time Performance: Optimized for fast and accurate detection, capable of running in real-time on standard hardware.
Multiple Poses: Supports multi-person pose detection to track and estimate poses for several individuals in the same scene.
Cross-Platform: Compatible with different platforms, including desktop and mobile devices.
Pre-trained Models: Includes pre-trained models to get started quickly, or you can train your own models with custom datasets.
Requirements
Python 3.13.3, Python 3.8.10
TensorFlow / PyTorch
OpenCV
NumPy
(Additional dependencies as required by the implementation)
